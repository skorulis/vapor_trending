docker image prune -a

* CI, deployment
	- I should try to get what I have running on DO
	
* Clean up GIT stuff to clear out the keys.
	- I should probably put them somewhere safer
	- I could make a secrets repository
	
Option 1: Secrets in a private git repo
	- Can be shared between multiple apps
	- Safe and easy to use
	- Prevents the app from being built without access
	- First practice with swift package manager

* Create logger for jobs
* Look into performance monitoring / logging solutions
* Migrate twitter job to work more like google so I can delete 1 field
	
* Create consistent error format between all platforms

* Migrate all data sources to not start with an array



* Setup CI pipeline to do tests on each commit of my server app
* Add testing data to show previews of screens for SwiftUI. Need to keep this working as it will be useful one day



* Add my fonts and typography to DS
* Start creating a RN component guide
* Sort places by number of votes.
* Use 1K instead of random numbers

The next main issue is getting better data

1. I need to not track points which are the same as the previous one to save memory.
2. I need some indication of numbers on my charts. Looks like I'm going to have to build axis myself
3. Allowing different view methods (top, trending, new)
top = Highest value in 24hr
trending = biggest swing in 24hr
new = Highest latest point


I need to look at deployment, to start getting solid data, I should probably run online first.
